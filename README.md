How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure I must spend enough time testing it in different ways. Using a combination of static and 
dynamic testing techniques I can catch and address defects early in the development process to avoid costly repairs later on. Testing can be performed manually but also using software that automates the tests can help speed up the process and achieve better results.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are interpreted by analyzing software requirements. These are a set of instructions that indicated what the program is expected to do. After understanding the 
requirements, code can than begin to be written and tested based on these requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
Software designing is approached by first doing manual reviews to make sure all the requirements are understood. Then different models can begin to be written to specify 
the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. These models should also be tested as much as possible before write code. Using these models developers can begin to create the classes along with its attributes that will make up the program. Again these classes should also be tested before calling it a finish product.
